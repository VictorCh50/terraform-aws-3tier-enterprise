## Terraform AWS 3-Tier Enterprise Architecture
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to design and provision a secure, scalable, and production-style 3-tier web application infrastructure on AWS using Terraform (Infrastructure as Code).

The infrastructure follows industry best practices by separating concerns into network, web, and database layers, ensuring security, maintainability, and repeatability.
